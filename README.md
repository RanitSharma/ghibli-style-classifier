# AI-Generated Ghibli Style Classifier

This project uses machine learning models in R to predict the **Style Accuracy Score (categorized)** of AI-generated Ghibli-style images, based on a 2025 dataset.

## 📊 Dataset
- **Title**: AI Generated Ghibli Style Image Trends (2025)
- **Target**: Style Accuracy Score (categorized)
- **Features**: Color palette, subject type, shading complexity, background detail, etc.

## ⚙️ Methods
- Data preprocessing in R
- Built classification models using:
  - Decision Trees (`rpart`)
  - Naive Bayes (`e1071`)
- Evaluated performance via cross-validation and confusion matrix

## 📈 Results
- Best model: Decision Tree with ~78% accuracy
- Key finding: Images with detailed backgrounds and stylized characters scored higher
